6. Ticker scroll component for Framer

Ticker scroll component.

The Ticker scroll component is a game-changer for scroll-based interactions. While it resembles Framer’s built-in ticker component, the magic here is that the frames don’t autoplay with a looping motion. Instead, they react to the user’s scrolling.

A perfect addition to make your website feel dynamic and responsive.

Spiral 3D scroll animation.

The spiral 3D scroll animation is a masterclass in visual storytelling. This animation builds a 3D space using transforms with perspective and rotation. Within this space, five “arms” hold cards that are positioned in a spiral layout, each with unique rotations.

To bring it all together, the spiral structure is placed in a sticky frame for smooth scrolling, and each card features a hover variant for added interactivity.
